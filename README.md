# ReplyChallenge2022

This branch contains DickinsonAlex's work for the Reply Coding Challenge 2022 - Challenge 4

The code was created over four hours from scratch to find a strong path between levels in a tower containing monsters

The code needs some extra debugging to avoid getting occasionally stuck in corners
